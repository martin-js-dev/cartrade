					<h2>History of sports cars </h2>
					<p class="quote">A sports car is designed to emphasise handling, performance or thrill of driving.</p>
					<p class="text">The basis for the sports car is traced to the early 20th century touring cars and roadsters, and the term 'sports car' would not be coined until after World War One.A car considered to be "a sports-car years ahead of its time" is the 1903 Mercedes Simplex 60 hp,[44] described at the time as a fast touring car and designed by Wilhelm Maybach and Paul Daimler. The Mercedes included pioneering features such as a pressed-steel chassis, a gated 4-speed transmission, pushrod-actuated overhead inlet valves, a honeycomb radiator, low-tension magneto ignition, a long wheelbase, a low centre of mass and a very effective suspension system</p>
					<p class="text"> As early as 1910, carmakers realized that while some people just wanted a reliable car, others wanted speed. By the late 1920s, sports cars began to look different from other cars, with big, powerful engines under long hoods. The driver sat near the rear wheels, rather than toward the front as in early vehicles. Good weight distribution like this allowed the car to be more stable in motion, especially when turning corners at high speeds. Modern sports cars may have their engine in the front, middle, or rear, but they all guarantee fast, exciting driving.</p>

					<h2>What's changed now</h2>
					<p class="quote">Traditional sports cars were typically two-seat roadsters.</p>
					<p class="text">Although the first sports cars were derived from fast tourers, and early sporting regulations often demanded four seats (even three-seaters were often produced by coachbuilders), two seats became common from about the mid-1920s. Modern sports cars may also have small back seats that are often really only suitable for luggage or small children; such a configuration is referred to as a 2+2 (two full seats + two "occasional" seats).</p>
					<p class="text">Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to increase the practicality of their vehicles by increasing the seating room. One method is to place the driver's seat in the center of the car, which allows two full-sized passenger seats on each side and slightly behind the driver. The arrangement was originally considered for the Lamborghini Miura, but abandoned as impractical because of the difficulty for the driver to enter/exit the vehicle. McLaren used the design in their F1.</p>
